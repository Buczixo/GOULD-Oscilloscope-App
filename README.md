## GOULD-Oscilloscope-App

An app, for use with a GOULD Classic 6100 series oscilloscope, communication is via the RS423 port on the back on the machine,
from PC side you will either need a USB to RS232 adapter, or a RS232 port built in the machine.

Plan is to have all the commands from the manual written to a dialogue inside the app for easy reach and implementation of self written per-user codes
for testing parts or measurments automation.

App is planned to use a HP plotter emulator from http://www.ke5fx.com/gpib/7470.htm for getting and displaying plots dirrectly on the PC.
